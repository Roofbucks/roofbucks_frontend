          <h4>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h4>

            including:
          </p>
          <ul className={styles.list2}>
            <li>
              <b>To provide you with the Services</b>.  We cannot provide the
              Services to you without collecting certain personal and financial
              information. For example, in order for you to complete certain
              transactions between your bank account and your Roofbucks mobile
              application, we need to gather information related to your bank
              and that transaction.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>To comply with legal requirements.</b>  Roofbucks is subject to
              various legal and regulatory compliance obligations that require
              us to verify your identity in connection with providing the
              Services.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>To keep your account secure</b>. In order to make sure that
              only you can access your account and to prevent fraudulent
              transactions, we need to verify your identity and your security
              credentials during log-in and in connection with completing
              certain transactions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>To provide you with customer support</b>. In order to

              certain information you provide to us or that we collect through
              your use of the Site and the Services.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>To improve Roofbucks</b>. In order to improve the Services we
              provide we need to know what is working (and what isn’t) so that
              we can combine that feedback and information with that of other
              customers to make changes.
            </li>

          <h4>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</h4>
          <p>
            Roofbucks has implemented measures intended to secure your
            information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use,
            alteration, and disclosure. You also play an important role in
            maintaining the safety and security of your information. Where we
            have given you access credentials, such as a username and password,
            you are responsible for keeping these credentials confidential.
            Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is
            not completely secure, and no company, including Roofbucks, can
            fully eliminate security risks. Although we have implemented
            measures to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the
            security of your information transmitted to or from us, including
            via email, or the security of any links accessible from our site.

            and operated by third parties (“Third-Party Sites”).  We encourage

            you understand how those websites collect, use, and share your
