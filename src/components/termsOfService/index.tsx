              <b>Specific Terms Agreed to by You.</b> If you qualify to
              participate in one or more Roofbucks products or services, we may
              ask you to enter into one or more supplemental agreements with us.
              In that event, the terms contained in those agreements will

            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Other Supplemental Notices.</b> Additionally, we may supplement
              this User Agreement with other supplemental notices posted on
              specific web pages within the Site or within the Roofbucks mobile
              application

              <b>Partner Terms.</b> Some of the services and features that you
              can access through the Roofbucks Platform (“Third Party Services”)
              are offered directly by, or in partnership with, third parties
              (“Third Party Providers”). As part of accessing those Third Party
              Services you may be required to agree to additional terms and
              conditions directly with one or more Third Party Providers, and
              those terms shall govern your use of such Third Party Services
              (“Third Party Terms”).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>ACCOUNT ELIGIBILITY & REGISTRATION</h4>
          <ul className={styles.list2}>
            <li>
              <b>Eligibility</b>. Certain elements of the Roofbucks Platform are
              publicly accessible, such as the Roofbucks website. However, to
              use certain features of the Roofbucks Platform, you must be at
              least 18 years old and reside in Africa. Additionally, certain
              products and services may not be available within your specific
              state or territory. As we are able to expand the availability of
              the Roofbucks Platform to additional jurisdictions, you may gain
              access to certain products and services that were not previously
              available. Conversely, we may cease offering certain products and
              services in a given jurisdiction from time to time.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Registration</b>. To access many of the features of the
              Roofbucks Platform, you must register for an account (an
              “Account”), which will require you to provide certain information
              to Roofbucks including your name, email address, phone number,
              date of birth and other information that we may request. In
              creating an Account and submitting any information to Roofbucks,
              you agree that all such information is accurate and that should
              any of the information change, you will notify us as soon as
              possible.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b> Account Security</b>.  In creating and maintaining your
              Account, you are responsible for creating a strong password and
              maintaining security and control of such password and any other
              login information.  You also agree to take whatever other security
              measures available, such as two-factor authentication through your
              mobile phone number or mobile device. Failure to do so may result
              in an unauthorised third party gaining access to your Account,
              which could result in the loss of personal and financial data as
              well as loss of funds available within your Account or any linked
              bank account.  Further, you agree to never share your login
              credentials with any other person, or allow anyone else to access
              your Account.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Identity Verification.</b>  In order to verify your identity
              and the accuracy of the information provided by you during Account
              registration we may require you to submit certain additional
              information or documentation, including, without limitation, a
              copy of an unexpired government issued photo identification card
              such as a driver’s license or passport.  Further, you hereby
              authorize us, or a third party service provider that we designate,
              to take any steps necessary to further verify your identity.  If
              we are unable to verify your Account information or we determine
              that the information provided by you is incorrect, we may be
              required to prevent you from creating an Account, close or suspend
              your existing Account, or take any other steps we determine to be
              necessary.
